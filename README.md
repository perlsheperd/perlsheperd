# SYNOPSIS

Once a client relationship is established, prefer to have a monthly service contract of 10-15 hours/mo. Rates are negotiable, but start at 90/hr.

# ABOUT PERL AND ME

Perl is a modern miracle, but can be unforgiving to most. I love Perl. I'm a Perl expert. I am kind, fair, and patient. I have over 20 years of Perl programming and training experience. I love Perl and helping people to solve their problems. I can provide anything a client might need for Perl and their systems using it. Perl is a critical, yet esoteric language. Many who manage Perl scripts rely on them, yet did not write them nor understand how they work. I can help assess your situation and providing recommendations on paths forward, hopefully involves me deep into your Perl code! :-)

# PRIVACY

I am very discreet and come with an automatic unilateral NDA. Sometimes I require them myself.
